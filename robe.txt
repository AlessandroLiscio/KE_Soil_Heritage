1) Analysis of existing datasets using heterogeneous formats, to produce RDF knowledge graphs
2) Application of the eXtreme Design methodology (competency questions, ODP reuse, testing,
etc.) to develop OWL ontologies for the knowledge graphs



3) Definition of mapping rules for transforming input data into semantic web knowledge graphs,
according to the developed ontologies
4) Generation of URIs and publication of ontologies and knowledge graphs (with permanent URIs)
5) Application/use/configuration of tools for entity linking
6) Application/use/configuration of tools for ontology alignment



7) Publication of a SPARQL endpoint
8) Integration of LODView for knowledge graph browsing
9) Integration of LODE for producing human-readable documentation of the ontologies
Ex. https://github.com/anuzzolese/OntoPiA-UI


10) Creation of a docker that will contain data, software, SPARQL endpoint, website and all the
necessary dependencies
